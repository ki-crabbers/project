# Wood Survey

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of wood survey is to analyse some information about trees. I'm a very out of my depth evolutionary anatomist who prefers to research things with vertebral columns.

A (broken) report of the analysis can be found [here](report.html) 

However I couldn't get quarto to work RIP. 

Apparently Details about the data used can be found [here](data/index/html)
