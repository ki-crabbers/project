<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of wood survey is to analyse some information about trees. I'm a very out of my depth evolutionary anatomist who prefers to research things with vertebral columns.

A report of the analysis can be found [here](report.html) 

Details about the data used can be found [here](data/index/html)
